# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- Replace separate Spotify, artist, and collection search fields with one
  context-aware search bar throughout the app. The checked **In …** control
  filters the open area and can be unchecked to search all of Spotify.
- Add Spotify-style shortcuts for search, navigation, playback, seeking,
  shuffle, repeat, mute, and volume, plus shortcut hints on matching controls.
- Add a themed, scrollable keyboard-shortcut reference with `Ctrl+/`; playback
  shortcuts automatically pause while typing in a text field.
- Open artists directly from every artist label, including individual artists
  on collaborations, album headers, media rows, and both players.
- Open the current song directly in Omasing Lyrics from either player, passing
  the exact recording metadata and playback position so lyrics can load without
  another search and open near the current line.
- Ask before installing and enabling Omasing when the optional lyrics plugin is
  missing, with progress, retryable errors, and an explicit unsandboxed-plugin
  notice.
- Move playlist creation into a focused popup opened by the **+** beside
  Playlists in the sidebar.
- Rearrange songs in owned playlists by dragging their cards while using the
  original playlist order, with edge auto-scroll and immediate feedback while
  Spotify saves the new order.
- Give artist-scoped searches a dedicated responsive results page for songs,
  albums, and playlists, hiding empty categories instead of retaining the
  artist-home layout.

### Refinements

- Streamline the sidebar by removing the redundant Search and Devices entries.
  Search is available from the shared header, while Devices remains beside the
  volume slider and is also available through `Alt+Shift+D`.
- Make Escape dismiss popups and clear search first, then use a theme-colored
  close-button warning before a second Escape closes the window.
- Preserve universal-search results and their underlying page when opening an
  item and going Back, and prevent an old query from covering Settings or a
  newly selected page.
- Release keyboard focus from search as soon as a selected song starts playing,
  so playback shortcuts work immediately.
- Keep this computer available in Spotify Connect while the mini player or full
  app is open, waking local playback and refreshing its device registration when
  either surface appears.
- Automatically select this computer when it is already the active player and
  no device was selected, while continuing to preserve an active remote target.
- Keep podcast, show, and audiobook subtitles as plain text instead of treating
  them as artist links.
- Move an already-open full player to the current workspace when opening it
  from the mini player, without requiring a second click.
- Polish the shortcut reference with theme-native borders, enough room for its
  scrollbar, and stable section sizing without layout-binding warnings.
- Collapse a song row's secondary actions behind an expand button whenever
  showing them would truncate its title.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-08-13

- Use Omarchy Spotify consistently as the product name.
- Document the user-initiated, narrowly scoped playback setup and its exact
  privileged package-install command.

- Show active playback from remote Spotify Connect devices, including Sonos
  players omitted from Spotify's available-device response or reported without
  a device id.
- Activate Sonos and other authorization-code receivers with their advertised
  OAuth flow instead of sending an incompatible reusable-credential blob.
- Mark restricted active devices clearly and avoid sending controls that the
  Spotify Web API will reject.
- Keep new song selections on the currently active Spotify Connect device,
  falling back to this computer only when no device is active.
- Control locally discovered Sonos playback, seeking, modes, and volume over
  its fixed LAN endpoints when Spotify marks the device restricted.
- Keep the remote volume slider visible when Spotify omits its nullable volume
  reading, including an authoritative local volume read for Sonos.
- Reconnect to a previously authorized Sonos by waking its retained session,
  with transient receiver retries and OAuth activation as fallback.
- Show locally advertised aliases for active speakers whose Spotify API name is
  only an opaque device id, and honor JBL-style access-token activation.
